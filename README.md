# React Native App w/StackNavigator & React Redux

>Focus is on [react-navigation StackNavigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html#creating-a-stack-navigator) handling click event to move to the next page when the user selects a item from a 
FlatList Component. We show the [FlatList Component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist), the use of the StackNavigator but instead of passing parameters between pages,
we use the [React Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) to update the state to show the current item on the detail page
